Segment Selection

Three segments are supported:
Mobility
FWA (Fixed Wireless Access)
Solution
Based on the selected segment, data is fetched from corresponding database tables and transformed into the required structure.

Step 1: Database Setup
Define Tables and Fields for Each Segment

For Mobility, fetch data from MobilityTable:
BUSINESS_ID, BUSINESS_NAME, SMARTPHONE_HEADROOM, TABLET_HEADROOM, ACTIVE_LINES, TABLET_LINES, MOBILITY_ACTION_LINE1-3, MOBILITY_WHY_LINE1-3.
For FWA, fetch data from FWATable:
BUSINESS_ID, BUSINESS_NAME, TOTAL_BANDWIDTH_USAGE, CUSTOMER_LOCATION, DEVICE_COUNT, FWA_ACTION_LINE1-3, FWA_WHY_LINE1-3.
For Solution, fetch data from SolutionTable:
BUSINESS_ID, BUSINESS_NAME, CLOUD_USAGE, STORAGE_REQUIREMENTS, ACTIVE_USERS, SOLUTION_ACTION_LINE1-3, SOLUTION_WHY_LINE1-3.


Table 2: Instruction Fields
This table contains predefined fields for mobility actions and insights. Examples include:

MOBILITY_ACTION_LINE1, MOBILITY_ACTION_LINE2, MOBILITY_ACTION_LINE3
MOBILITY_WHY_LINE1, MOBILITY_WHY_LINE2, MOBILITY_WHY_LINE3
The fields in Table 2 are consolidated into two main fields:

Action: Combines all MOBILITY_ACTION fields.
Insight: Combines all MOBILITY_WHY fields.

Output from the LLM: The LLM generates new, elaborated responses for each action and insight, providing reasoning

UI Implementation with Gradio
User Interface: A Gradio-based UI is created to:

Accept customer name and input fields.
Display LLM-generated responses in real-time.
UI Components:

Input Fields:
Customer Name
Custom Data Path
Segments
Action Buttons:
Run: Processes the input fields and generates LLM responses.
Test: Simulates the LLM workflow for testing purposes.
Output Fields:
Display the elaborated actions and insights.





Prompt Construction:

Segment-specific data is combined into a structured prompt format to guide the LLM.
LLM Response Generation

The prompt is sent to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to generate detailed actions and elaborated insights for the selected segment.
UI and Interaction

A Gradio-based frontend allows users to input the desired segment and fetch corresponding responses.
